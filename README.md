# Cyto Flow

03/31/2024:
- Set up basics for the training of Isolation Forest model to detect rare events in Flow Cytometry Data, including a feedback system and a looping training system.
- Modified the CytometryAnalysis file to cluster data based on correlation values via agglomerative clustering. Removed t-SNE modelling for now, pending further review and study.
